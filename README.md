Objective:
  DOM manipulation practice through creating a webpage which allows the user to manipulate a grid of cells by:

  - adding and removing columns
  - colouring the cells directly, at the click of a button (unfilled and all), or by dragging their mouse
  - reverting any colour manipulation with a 'Clear' button
